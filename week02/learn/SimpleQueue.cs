        // Defect(s) Found: The Enque method was using insert as the method to add values to the queue, it was inserting items at index 0, this meant all the values were being pushed back in the list, the list was becoming a first in last out type of queue, using Add resolves the issue, because it adds items in the last index of the list, so when the first one is inserted, it remains in the same index, wich is 0, and then, when removed, it removes from index 0, and the item wich was at index 1 moves to index 0 and so on.
